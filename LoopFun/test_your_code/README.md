# Instructions

* Put your code in loop_fun_student.py
* Run loop_fun_tester.py which write your program's outputs to student_output.txt
* See if student_output.txt matches expected_output.txt

This is pretty janky, I use unit testing if I were to do it again. Also, I did this in OS X, I don't know if it works on Windows.
