# Instructions

* Put your code in loop_fun_student.py
* Run loop_fun_tester.py which writes the output of loop_fun_student.py to student_output.txt
* See if student_output.txt matches expected_output.txt. You can do a side-by-side comparison in Pycharm by doing a split view. You can also use something like [Text Compare](https://text-compare.com/)

I did this in OS X, I don't know if it works on Windows. You can use ChatGPT to modify the tester code if it doesn't work. I also have no idea how it would work in GitHub spaces. You could just manually type my test cases and see if the output looks like the expected results.
